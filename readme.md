# Polynomial Multiplication of O(n^1.585)
> Introducing, the Karatsuba Algorithm.

## Introduction
This is a small project created in order to fulfill the needs of IF2211 Strategi Algoritma course on ITB. This project contains an implementation of the __Karatsuba Algorithm__, which does polynomial multiplication in a theoretically faster execution time.
